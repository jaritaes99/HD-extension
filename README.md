#HD Extension

This repository holds the notebooks used in the HD extension project.

We are trying to extend the HD domain of MCRaT such that the MCRaT photons can continue to interact with the HD medium outside of the HD domain, where the outflow is predicted to be homologous. 

For more information, read the progress_so_far.pdf file, along with all the notebooks in this repository.
